# 1) - What are the advantages of using Git?.
  Ans: Git is a version control and tracking system and helps us to keep track and revert back to those changes in our development cycle. 
       With Git, we can easily track changes, identify the causes of Bugs using our tracking, and create separate branches or workflows for 
       development without affecting the main development process.

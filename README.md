# Github-Assignment
A repository containing the answers of all the questions in the Github assignment.

# 1) - What are the advantages of using Git?.
       Git is a version control and tracking system and helps us to keep track and revert back to those changes in our development cycle. 
       With Git, we can easily track changes, identify the causes of Bugs using our tracking, and create separate branches or workflows for 
       development without affecting the main development process.
# 2) - What language is used in Git?.
       Git is mainly built using C and Python Programming Languages.

# 3) - What is the meaning of index and Staging Area in Git?
       Git index is the "holding area" of the main tree whose changes would be committed to the main branch. We can choose the files which 
       we want to commit and those files would be present in the Git index. Git staging area helps break one large commit into several 
       small components. Besides this, Staging is also used to track and resolve merge conflicts when we commit our changes into the main t
       tree.

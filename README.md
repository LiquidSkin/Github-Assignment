# Github-Assignment
A repository containing the answers of all the questions in the Github assignment.

# 1) - What are the advantages of using Git?.
       Git is a version control and tracking system and helps us to keep track and revert back to those changes in our development cycle. 
       With Git, we can easily track changes, identify the causes of Bugs using our tracking, and create separate branches or workflows for 
       development without affecting the main development process.
# 2) - What language is used in Git?.
       Git is mainly built using C and Python Programming Languages.

# 3) - What is the meaning of index and Staging Area in Git?
       Git index is the "holding area" of the main tree whose changes would be committed to the main branch. We can choose the files which 
       we want to commit and those files would be present in the Git index. Git staging area helps break one large commit into several 
       small components. Besides this, Staging is also used to track and resolve merge conflicts when we commit our changes into the main t
       tree.

# 4) - What is the process of creating a repository in Github?
       - On the upper right corner of your account, Click on the Plus account.
       - Enter the necessary details like name of the repository and you have the additional options of making the repository either public 
         or private and you can also initialize it with a readme file.

# 5) - What is head in Git and how many heads can be created?
       Head refers to the current branch of the Git Repository. A reposiroty can have many heads.
       
# 6) - Why do we need branching in Git?
        Git Branches are required to work on the code separately without disturing the main branch which usually contains production 
        ready code. Also multiple people can work on the same code, Branching makes this easier as each developer can work separately 
        with the help of branches.
        
 # 7) - What is the way to create a new branch in Git?
        The command to create a new branch is git checkout branchname.
   
 # 8) - How do you define a conflict in Git?
        A git conflict occurs usually when two separate and different changes have been made to the same line in the code. They also
        occur when one/multiple lines of code are missing in one branch but are present. Conflicts are basically inconsistencies
        which occur in the codebase when multiple are working on the same part of the codebase.
 
 # 9) - How to resolve conflicts in Git?.
        Git conflicts can be resolved by using git status command and tracking all the conflicts.Usually the process involves discussion
        between the two developers whose branches are conflicting. The developers then decide which parts of the code to be kept,
        discarded and what changes should be made in the codebase to resolve the conflicts.
 
 # 10) - What is the use of a Git Config File?
         Git config file is used to modify and assign the settings of a repository. The Git config file usually contains the user email 
         user username. It also contains all the dependencies associated with a branch.
